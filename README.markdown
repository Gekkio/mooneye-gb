# Mooneye GB

Mooneye GB is a Game Boy research project and emulator written in Rust.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-gb/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-gb/actions)

The main goals of this project are accuracy and documentation. Some existing
emulators are very accurate (Gambatte, BGB >= 1.5) but are not documented very
clearly, so they are not that good references for emulator developers. I want
this project to document as clearly as possible *why* certain behaviour is
emulated in a certain way. This also means writing a lot of test ROMs to figure
out corner cases and precise behaviour on real hardware.

For documentation about known behaviour, see [Game Boy: Complete Technical Reference](https://github.com/Gekkio/gb-ctr)

*Looking for the mooneye-gb test ROMs?* They are now part of [Mooneye Test Suite](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-test-suite/).

Non-goals:

* CGB (Game Boy Color) support. It would be nice, but I want to make the normal
  Game Boy support extremely robust first.
* A debugger
* A good user interface. Building native UIs with Rust is a bit painful at the
  moment.

**Warning**:

* Project is WIP
* Doesn't work properly without a boot ROM
* The emulator is lagging behind hardware research. I don't want to spend time
  making short-lived and probably incorrect fixes to the emulator if I'm not
  sure about the hardware behaviour.

## Performance

**Always compile in release mode if you care about performance!**

On a i7-3770K desktop machine I can usually run ROMs with 2000 - 4000% speed.
Without optimizations the speed drops to 150 - 200%, which is still fine for
development purposes.

Raspberry Pi with X11 desktop works but is too slow because there is no OpenGL
acceleration.

The emulator is runnable on Android, but cross-compiling and packaging is a
huge pain and touch controls would have to be implemented, so I'm not
supporting Android at the moment.

## Running the emulator

Requirements:

* Rust 1.26
* SDL2 development libraries for your platform must be installed

### GUI

1. `cargo run --release`
2. Follow the instructions

### Command-line
1. Acquire a Game Boy bootrom, and put it to `$HOME/.local/share/mooneye-gb/bootroms/dmg_boot.bin`
2. `cargo build --release`
3. `cargo run --release -- PATH_TO_GAMEBOY_ROM`

On Windows, also download an SDL2 package containing SDL2.dll, and put it to
`target/debug` and `target/release`.

### Game Boy keys

| Game Boy | Key        |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Dpad     | Arrow keys |
| A        | Z          |
| B        | X          |
| Start    | Return     |
| Select   | Backspace  |

### Other keys

| Function                   | Key       |
| -------------------------- | --------- |
| Fast forward               | Shift     |
| Toggle performance overlay | F2        |

## Test suite

### Blargg's tests

| Test              | mooneye-gb |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| cpu instrs        | :+1:       |
| dmg sound 2       | :x:        |
| instr timing      | :+1:       |
| mem timing 2      | :+1:       |
| oam bug 2         | :x:        |
| cgb sound 2       |            |

Notes:

* cpu_instrs fails on MGB/SGB2 hardware and emulators emulating them correctly.
  The ROM incorrectly detects the device as CGB, and attempts to perform a CPU
  speed change which causes a freeze (STOP instruction with joypad disabled)
* dmg_sound-2 test #10 can fail randomly on real hardware and seems to depend
  on non-deterministic behaviour.
* oam_bug-2 fails on all CGB, AGB, and AGS devices
* cgb_sound-2 test #03 fails on CPU CGB, CPU CGB A, and CPU CGB B
